### Interactive Space Simulation

This project is an interactive 3D space simulation created with the **Three.js** JavaScript library. The simulation displays the Earth, the Moon, and a field of stars, synchronizing Earth's rotation with the local time to accurately show the position of day and night.

### Project Goal

My objective with this project was not only to create a visual simulation but also to learn the basics of web programming and 3D graphics in JavaScript. I have very limited programming knowledge, which is why I decided to use an artificial intelligence as a support and learning tool.

### Acknowledgment to Artificial Intelligence

I want to thank the AI for guiding me during the creation of this project. It played a fundamental role by helping me write the code, understand complex Three.js concepts, and solve the various synchronization and lighting issues I encountered. Without its help, this project would not have been possible.

I hope you enjoy this simulation and can appreciate it as an example of how artificial intelligence can be used as a powerful tool for learning and creation.

### How to Run the Simulation

1.  Download all project files (including the `.js` files and texture images).
2.  Open the `earth_and_moon.html` file in a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3.  Use your mouse or touchscreen gestures to interact with the simulation.
